You can freely move, copy, or rename this directory. 

Do not change ARM.assembler and ARM.system files because
the SSPARCSS applications may stop working in this directory.

Also, do not change *.ini files because SSPARCSS applications
may loose all saved settings that you have adjusted (i.e. it may
go back to default settings). Ini-files will be created after
you use the SSPARCSS applications for the first time.

Keep all your assembly programs (*.a) and their translations
into 'executable' files (*.e) in this directory.
